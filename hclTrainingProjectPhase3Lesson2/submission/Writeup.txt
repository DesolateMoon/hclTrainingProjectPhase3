This program displays User feedback. It is a Spring Boot project that will capture user feedback using
a REST endpoint. The REST resouroce will take in parameters using HTTP Post. THe feedback data will be
then added to a database table. Feedback data will be received from third-party apps and websites. The 
data will be sent to the REST API which will collect feedback from various sources. The repository class
will follow the design guidelines  as it will be mapped to the entity class to the CrudRepository interface.

I created the project utilizing start.spring.io. I imported devtools along with other necessary dependencies.
I then created a simple POJO for the Product and Feedback. I linked the two databases together using the 
annotations for onetomany and manytoone mapping. I then created the Controller which will be the core of this 
application. I started with implementing addProduct first along with the corresponding jsp page. In order to
get this functionality wokring I had to implement ProductDAO which extends CrudRepository. After this was
done it was mostly code reptition to get the other parts working. One nuance that I had to implement was in 
addReview. I needed a sorter so I had to implement a comparator Feedback.

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, and Spring Boot with Hibernate.
