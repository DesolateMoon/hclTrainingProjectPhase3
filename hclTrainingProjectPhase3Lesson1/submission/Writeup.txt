This program searches for a specific user and updates the user information. It is a Spring MVC web 
application that will retrieve users based on their user ID. the retrieved user data will then be 
edited in a form and updated in the database. The entire database processing will be done using Hibernate 
and the front pages will be made in JSP. If the ID is invalid, a JSP page will be displayed with an
error message. The standard methodlogy of creating controllers, services, dao, and entity classes were
applied. 

I created the project utilizing start.spring.io. I imported devtools along with other necessary dependencies.
I then created a simple POJO for the User. This was followed by creating two interfaces for the service and
DAO. I then created the Controller which will be the core of this application. I started with a preloaded 
database so I worked on the search functionality first along with the corresponding jsp page. In order
to get this functionality working, I need to implement UserService which implements UserDAO. After this was
done it was mostly code reptition to get the other parts working. 

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server along with Spring MVC with Hibernate, log4j as the logger, and MySQL Connector for the 
database.
