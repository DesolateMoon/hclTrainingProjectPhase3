This program handles User Authentication. It is a standalone project which will do unit testing of the
user authentication class which is used in the main web application. The JUnit class will test all aspects
of the authentication class. The test suite that is being created will do unit testing of all backend
components in the web application. It will not directly test servlets or web pages. It will only test
the classes that have the business logic. 

I created a simple maven project. I then created a User POJO utilizing lombok. I then continued to create 
the Authentication class which will handle the main functionality of the program. It will allow someone to
login, logout, getRole, getUsername. I then wrote a tester in the src/test/java to begin the JUnit 
requirement. For the JUnit tests to be identified I used the necessary @Test annotation. However,
I want the data to prepopulated before each test so I used the @BeforeEach annotation to do the necessary.
I then utilized the basic assertEquals to test the needed functionality.

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized the Eclipse IDE which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. Apache Tom Cat was utilized as the 
web server, and Jupiter Junit5.
